# Searchable List

## Description

A component for displaying different types of items based on the specific interface, which is documented inside
the `CSearchableList` file.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 20.x or later. To check your current Node.js version, run:
  ```bash
  node -v

## Installing the dependencies:

  ```bash
    npm install
  ````

## Run the storybook:

````
    npm run storybook
````

## Run tests:
````
    npm test
````

## TODO list:
- Make specific items from the contacts list clickable (for now only the hover effect is applying)
- Make more explicit props for the component itself (for now, the props list looks pretty unclear in terms of input data for the list, especially in terms of the structure of the data itself)
- Chevron icon does not change direction when the user clicks on the section separator (should have changed the angle of rotation, to show that the list is open)
- The structure of the project does not look understandable
